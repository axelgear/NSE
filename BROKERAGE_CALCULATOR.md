## 🧪 **Test Your Calculation**

### Example 1: Small Trade
```
Sell 10 shares @ ₹500 = ₹5,000 turnover

Brokerage: ₹20.00 (minimum charge applies)
STT: ₹5,000 × 0.025% = ₹1.25
Exchange: ₹5,000 × 0.00297% = ₹0.15
SEBI: ₹5,000 × 0.00001% = ₹0.01
GST: (₹20 + ₹0.15 + ₹0.01) × 18% = ₹3.63
Stamp Duty: ₹5,000 × 0.003% = ₹0.15

Total Charges: ₹25.19
Net Proceeds: ₹4,974.81
```

### Example 2: Large Trade (Your Screenshot)
```
Sell 50 shares @ ₹1,500 = ₹75,000 turnover

Brokerage: ₹20.00 (capped at max)
STT: ₹75,000 × 0.025% = ₹18.75
Exchange: ₹75,000 × 0.00297% = ₹2.23
SEBI: ₹75,000 × 0.00001% = ₹0.01
GST: (₹20 + ₹2.23 + ₹0.01) × 18% = ₹4.00
Stamp Duty: ₹75,000 × 0.003% = ₹0.23

Total Charges: ₹45.22
Net Proceeds: ₹74,954.78
