# 🎉 NEW FEATURES - Stock & EMI Dashboard v2.0

## ✨ Major Enhancements Implemented

Your dashboard has been upgraded with powerful new features based on your requirements!

---

## 1. 📊 **Real-Time Stock Price API Integration**

### What's New:
- ✅ Integrated with **NSE/BSE Indian Stock Market API**
- ✅ Fetch **live prices** for any stock with a symbol
- ✅ **Bulk update** all stocks at once
- ✅ **Individual stock updates** via API
- ✅ **Automatic symbol suggestions**

### How to Use:

#### Option A: Update Individual Stock
```
1. Go to "Stock Portfolio" tab
2. Find any stock (must have symbol configured)
3. Click the purple "API Update" button
4. Stock price updates in real-time!
5. All other stocks with same name also update
```

#### Option B: Update All Stocks at Once
```
1. Click "Update Prices" button in header (purple button)
2. System fetches latest prices for all stocks
3. All stocks update simultaneously
4. Success notification shows when complete
```

### Stock Symbols:
Your current stocks already have symbols configured:
- **Ather Energy** → `ATHERENERGY` (NSE)
- **Tata Gold ETF** → `TGOLDETF` (NSE)

When adding new stocks, the system **auto-suggests** symbols based on company name!

---

## 2. 🔄 **Synchronized Pricing Across Same Stocks**

### The Problem You Mentioned:
> "currentPrice": 743.35, this should be common for all the same stock

### Solution Implemented:
✅ **Automatic price synchronization** across all stocks with the same name!

### How It Works:
```
Example:
- You have 5 lots of "Ather Energy" 
- Each lot bought at different prices
- But current price should be same for all

When you update price to ₹750:
1. System finds all "Ather Energy" stocks
2. Updates current price to ₹750 for ALL lots
3. Recalculates value and P/L for each lot
4. Maintains individual profit tracking
```

### Both Ways Work:
- **API Update**: Updates all same-name stocks
- **Manual Update**: Syncs across all same-name stocks

---

## 3. 💰 **Sold Price Tracking**

### What You Requested:
> sold price also

### Now Implemented:
✅ **Track exact sale price** for every stock sold  
✅ **Track quantity sold** (for partial sales)  
✅ **View sale history** in stock details

### Fields Added:
```typescript
soldPrice: 743.35        // Price at which sold
soldQuantity: 325        // Total quantity sold
status: 'partial'        // Shows if partially sold
```

### Example:
```
Stock: Ather Energy - 500 shares

First Sale: Sell 200 @ ₹740
- soldPrice: ₹740
- soldQuantity: 200
- status: 'partial'
- quantity: 300 (remaining)

Second Sale: Sell 100 @ ₹760  
- soldPrice: ₹760 (latest)
- soldQuantity: 300 (cumulative)
- quantity: 200 (remaining)
```
